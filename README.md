## üõ†Ô∏è Challenges and Solutions

### ‚ùå Previous Attempts by Other Developers 

1. **[2020 Dockerfile by Microsoft (not maintained, component outdated)](https://github.com/microsoft/scene_graph_benchmark/blob/main/docker/Dockerfile)**  
   - **Base Image**: `nvidia/cuda:10.1-cudnn7-devel-ubuntu18.04`.  
   - **Issue**: Image no longer available on Docker Hub, leading to build failures.

2. **[2020 Refactored Dockerfile (not maintained, component outdated)](https://github.com/microsoft/scene_graph_benchmark/blob/main/docker/Dockerfile)**  
   - **Base Image**: `nvidia/cuda:9.0-cudnn7-devel-ubuntu16.04`.  
   - **Issue**:  The image is outdated and removed from Docker Hub. Additionally, it uses PyTorch Nightly (pre-release), which is not ideal for production environments and leads to potential compatibility issues with newer dependencies.

### ‚úÖ Current Solution: 

3. **2024 Refactored Dockerfile Using NVIDIA NGC (current repository)**
   - **Base Image**: `nvcr.io/nvidia/pytorch20.10-py3`.  
   - **Key Features**:  
     - Based on NVIDIA NGC's optimized PyTorch container, which includes pre-installed CUDA, cuDNN, NCCL, and other essential libraries for deep learning.  
     - Supports Python 3.8 via Miniconda and includes PyTorch 1.7.0 with CUDA 11.0.  
     - Ensures compatibility with modern hardware and software stacks through NVIDIA's tested framework support matrix.  
     - Simplifies GPU runtime configuration using Docker Compose with `runtime: nvidia` and explicit GPU environment variables.  
     - Includes robust volume mapping for data, models, and output, enabling seamless interaction with host resources.  
     - Optimized for multi-GPU setups but also configurable for single-GPU use via environment variables.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. System Requirements

Ensure the following are installed on your host system:

- **[Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install)**  
- **[Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install)**  
- **[NVIDIA Container Toolkit](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/install-guide.html)**  
- **NVIDIA GPU** with up-to-date drivers installed.  

> For **Windows Users**:  
> - Install **WSL 2** (Windows Subsystem for Linux).  
> - Set up GPU support for Docker in WSL using NVIDIA's container toolkit.  
> - Install Docker Desktop and enable WSL integration.

### 2. NVIDIA NGC Authentication

The NVIDIA PyTorch container is hosted on **NVIDIA NGC**, which may require authentication for private images. Follow these steps to log in and pull the container:

#### Step 1: Create an NVIDIA NGC Account
- Go to [NVIDIA NGC](https://ngc.nvidia.com/signup) and create an account.

#### Step 2: Generate an API Key
- Log in to your NGC account.
- Navigate to the **API Key** page: [NGC API Key](https://ngc.nvidia.com/setup/api-key).
- Click **Generate API Key** and copy the key.

#### Step 3: Log in to NVIDIA NGC
Run the following command and provide your credentials:
```bash
docker login nvcr.io
```
- **Username**: `$oauthtoken`  
- **Password**: The API key you just generated.

#### Step 4: Pull the Docker Image
Once logged in, pull the NVIDIA PyTorch container:
```bash
docker pull nvcr.io/nvidia/pytorch:24.10-py3
```

---

### 3. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pakkinlau/scene_graph_benchmark_nvidia.git
cd scene_graph_benchmark_nvidia
```

### 4. Build the Docker Image

```bash
docker-compose build
```

### 5. Run the Container

```bash
docker-compose up
```

### 6. Interact with the Container

Attach to the running container's shell:
```bash
docker exec -it scene_graph_benchmark_docker-scene_graph_benchmark-1 zsh
```

Run the benchmark training script:
```bash
cd /lab_sg_extract/scene_graph_benchmark
python tools/train_net.py --config-file configs/e2e_relation_sgdet.yml
```

---

## üß™ Testing the Environment

1. **Verify GPU Access**  
   Run the following command inside the container:
   ```bash
   nvidia-smi
   ```

2. **Check PyTorch Installation**  
   Verify that PyTorch is installed and working:
   ```bash
   python -c "import torch; print(torch.__version__)"
   ```

3. **Install Scene Graph package**
   Run this command to install the package right after running the container.
   ```
   python /lab_sg_extract/scene_graph_benchmark/setup.py install
   ```

5. **Test the Training Script**  
   Run the scene graph benchmark training script:
   ```bash
   python tools/train_net.py --config-file configs/e2e_relation_sgdet.yml
   ```

## Refactoring Considerations

While the current Docker image successfully builds and runs, there are opportunities to refactor the setup for better modularity, lightweight execution, and robustness:

- **Base Image Alternatives**: Use a lighter base image (e.g., `ubuntu`) to reduce image size.  
- **Multi-Stage Builds**: Separate the development and runtime environments to create a cleaner, smaller image.  
- **Version Pinning**: Pin versions of CUDA, PyTorch, and dependencies to ensure stability.  
- **Automated Testing**: Integrate CI/CD pipelines to automatically test the Docker image against updates.
