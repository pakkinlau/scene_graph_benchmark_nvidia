### **Key Features**:  

  - Compatible with VSCode, as VSCode [stop supporting](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/faq#_what-linux-packages-or-libraries-need-to-be-installed-on-a-host-to-use-remote-development) ubuntu 18.04 or earlier version. 
  - Based on NVIDIA NGC's [optimized PyTorch container](https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/orgs/nvidia/containers/pytorch/tags), which includes pre-installed CUDA, cuDNN, NCCL, and other essential libraries for deep learning.  
  - Supports Python 3.8 via Miniconda and includes PyTorch 1.7.0 with CUDA 11.0.  
  - Ensures compatibility with Tested framework support matrix (PyTorch1.7 + CUDA 11.0 + Ubuntu 20.04 + Latest VSCode. )
  - Simplifies GPU runtime configuration using Docker Compose with `runtime: nvidia` and explicit GPU environment variables.  
  - Includes robust volume mapping for data, models, and output, enabling seamless interaction with host resources.  
  - Optimized for multi-GPU setups but also configurable for single-GPU use via environment variables.  


We switched to the NVIDIA PyTorch container (`nvcr.io/nvidia/pytorch:24.10-py3`), which is actively maintained by Nvidia NGC.

## üõ†Ô∏è **Discussion 1: Why choosing NVIDIA NGC?**

Compared to other standalone PyTorch containers or custom Dockerfiles, **NVIDIA NGC containers** offer the following advantages:

1. **Tested Compatibility**:  
   - NVIDIA rigorously tests their containers to ensure compatibility across **CUDA**, **PyTorch**, and system libraries.  
   - This repository uses NVIDIA's PyTorch container (`nvcr.io/nvidia/pytorch20.10-py3`), which includes **CUDA 11.0**, **cuDNN**, **NCCL**, and other essential deep learning frameworks.  

2. **Pre-installed Optimizations**:  
   - NVIDIA NGC containers come with pre-installed libraries, eliminating the need to manually configure CUDA and other GPU dependencies.  
   - These containers are optimized for multi-GPU setups, providing better performance for both training and inference tasks.  

3. **Ongoing Maintenance**:  
   - NVIDIA actively maintains and updates their NGC containers to ensure compatibility with the latest hardware and software stacks.  
   - Outdated base images often used in other implementations (e.g., Ubuntu 16.04 or CUDA 9.0) can lead to build failures and compatibility issues.

4. **Simplified GPU Configuration**:  
   - The repository is pre-configured to work with NVIDIA's `runtime: nvidia` in Docker Compose, ensuring seamless GPU access.

## üõ†Ô∏è  **Discussion 2: Compatibility Consideration**

This package is specifically designed to address common compatibility issues encountered in Scene Graph Benchmark implementations:

1. **Ubuntu Compatibility**:  
   - The NVIDIA NGC container is based on **Ubuntu 20.04**, providing compatibility with modern CUDA and PyTorch versions.  
   - Using older Ubuntu versions (e.g., 18.04 or 16.04) can lead to dependency conflicts with CUDA 11.0 or newer.  

2. **CUDA and PyTorch**:  
   - The repository uses **PyTorch 1.7** with **CUDA 11.0**, ensuring compatibility with NVIDIA's framework support matrix.  
   - Using unsupported CUDA versions (e.g., 10.x) with PyTorch 1.7 will result in runtime errors.  

3. **VS Code Development**:  
   - The container is compatible with VS Code's **Remote - Containers** extension, allowing seamless remote development.

## Refactoring Considerations

While the current Docker image successfully builds and runs, there are opportunities to refactor the setup for better modularity, lightweight execution, and robustness:

- **Base Image Alternatives**: Use a lighter base image (e.g., `ubuntu`) to reduce image size.  
- **Multi-Stage Builds**: Separate the development and runtime environments to create a cleaner, smaller image.  
- **Version Pinning**: Pin versions of CUDA, PyTorch, and dependencies to ensure stability.  
- **Automated Testing**: Integrate CI/CD pipelines to automatically test the Docker image against updates.
