# scene_graph_benchmark_nvidia

This repository provides a **November-2024-reworked** implementation of the Scene Graph Benchmark Docker container definition, aimed at tasks like scene graph generation, object detection, and relationship detection. The current implementation is based on NVIDIA's PyTorch container with GPU acceleration, ensuring compatibility with CUDA and cuDNN.

## üìÖ Project Timeline

This project is ongoing, and the Docker container is just one milestone among several tasks. Below is a progress timeline for the project:

- [x] Refactored the Docker container for Scene Graph Benchmark using NVIDIA PyTorch base image.  
- [ ] Begin implementation refinements for the `scene_graph_benchmark` package, focusing on bug fixes and adding support for new datasets.  
- [ ] Conduct experiments and benchmarks using the Scene Graph Benchmark package for our research project.  
- [ ] Publish results and release extended utilities for scene graph generation and object detection.  

> Note: While we are actively working on a research project involving this package, further details regarding our lab and research focus will be shared at a later date.

## üõ†Ô∏è Challenges and Solutions

### ‚ùå Previous Attempts

1. **[Microsoft's Dockerfile](https://github.com/microsoft/scene_graph_benchmark/blob/main/docker/Dockerfile)**  
   - **Base Image**: `nvidia/cuda:10.1-cudnn7-devel-ubuntu18.04`.  
   - **Issue**: Image no longer available, resulting in build failure.

2. **[2020 Refactored Dockerfile](https://github.com/microsoft/scene_graph_benchmark/blob/main/docker/Dockerfile)**  
   - **Base Image**: `nvidia/cuda:9.0-cudnn7-devel-ubuntu16.04`.  
   - **Issue**: Deprecated and removed from Docker Hub.

### ‚úÖ Current Solution: 2024 Refactored Dockerfile Using NVIDIA NGC

We switched to the NVIDIA PyTorch container (`nvcr.io/nvidia/pytorch:24.10-py3`), which is actively maintained and optimized for GPU-accelerated PyTorch workflows.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. System Requirements

Ensure the following are installed on your host system:

- **[Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install)**  
- **[Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install)**  
- **[NVIDIA Container Toolkit](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/install-guide.html)**  
- **NVIDIA GPU** with up-to-date drivers installed.  

> For **Windows Users**:  
> - Install **WSL 2** (Windows Subsystem for Linux).  
> - Set up GPU support for Docker in WSL using NVIDIA's container toolkit.  
> - Install Docker Desktop and enable WSL integration.

### 2. NVIDIA NGC Authentication

The NVIDIA PyTorch container is hosted on **NVIDIA NGC**, which may require authentication for private images. Follow these steps to log in and pull the container:

#### Step 1: Create an NVIDIA NGC Account
- Go to [NVIDIA NGC](https://ngc.nvidia.com/signup) and create an account.

#### Step 2: Generate an API Key
- Log in to your NGC account.
- Navigate to the **API Key** page: [NGC API Key](https://ngc.nvidia.com/setup/api-key).
- Click **Generate API Key** and copy the key.

#### Step 3: Log in to NVIDIA NGC
Run the following command and provide your credentials:
```bash
docker login nvcr.io
```
- **Username**: `$oauthtoken`  
- **Password**: The API key you just generated.

#### Step 4: Pull the Docker Image
Once logged in, pull the NVIDIA PyTorch container:
```bash
docker pull nvcr.io/nvidia/pytorch:24.10-py3
```

### 3. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pakkinlau/scene_graph_benchmark_nvidia.git
cd scene_graph_benchmark_nvidia
```

### 4. Build the Docker Image

```bash
docker-compose build
```

### 5. Run the Container

```bash
docker-compose up
```

### 6. Interact with the Container

Attach to the running container's shell:
```bash
docker exec -it scene_graph_benchmark_docker-scene_graph_benchmark-1 zsh
```

Run the benchmark training script:
```bash
cd /lab_sg_extract/scene_graph_benchmark
python tools/train_net.py --config-file configs/e2e_relation_sgdet.yml
```

---

## üß™ Testing the Environment

1. **Verify GPU Access**  
   Run the following command inside the container:
   ```bash
   nvidia-smi
   ```

2. **Check PyTorch Installation**  
   Verify that PyTorch is installed and working:
   ```bash
   python -c "import torch; print(torch.__version__)"
   ```

3. **Test the Training Script**  
   Run the scene graph benchmark training script:
   ```bash
   python tools/train_net.py --config-file configs/e2e_relation_sgdet.yml
   ```

## Refactoring Considerations

While the current Docker image successfully builds and runs, there are opportunities to refactor the setup for better modularity, lightweight execution, and robustness:

- **Base Image Alternatives**: Use a lighter base image (e.g., `ubuntu`) to reduce image size.  
- **Multi-Stage Builds**: Separate the development and runtime environments to create a cleaner, smaller image.  
- **Version Pinning**: Pin versions of CUDA, PyTorch, and dependencies to ensure stability.  
- **Automated Testing**: Integrate CI/CD pipelines to automatically test the Docker image against updates.
